    <h1>Running the Software</h1>
    <p>
      The program is designed to visualized one configuration space scene at
      a time. A scene contains the configuration space representation,
      the robot representation, the obstacle representation, and a polygonal
      path for the robot. Currently, you specify the scene when launching the
      software through a command-line argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a terminal (or command prompt on Windows), enter the cspace
      directory containing cspace.jar. Type the following:
      <div class="code">
        $ java -Xmx512m -jar cspace.jar &lt;path_to_scene&gt;
      </div>
      where &lt;path_to_scene&gt; is a directory containing a cspace and path
      file. The available scenes include:
      <ul>
        <li>scenes/2rooms</li>
        <li>scenes/2rooms_linear</li>
        <li>scenes/3pin</li>
        <li>scenes/5star</li>
        <li>scenes/7pin</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/scenes.png" height="150" /><br>
      Scenes from left to right: 2rooms, 3pin, 5star, 7pin. The robot outline
      is shown in blue, and the obstacle is gray.
    </div>
    <h1>User Interface</h1>
    <p>
      The main application window has four main widgets:
      <ul>
        <li>The 2D/3D rendering panel is located at the center.</li>
        <li>The settings button is at the bottom left.</li>
        <li>The motion planning button is to the right of the settings.</li>
        <li>The path slider is at the bottom.</li>
      </ul>
      Initially, the software should display both the 2D and 3D views in the
      rendering panel. The 2D viewport and 3D viewport refer to the portions
      of this panel that contain the 2D or 3D illustrations respectively.
    </p>
    <h2>2D View Controls</h2>
    <p>
      When the mouse cursor is inside the 3D viewport, the following operations
      can be performed:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Camera translation: hold the W, A, S, D keys to move the camera
          forward, left, back, and right respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          Camera rotation: left-click and drag the mouse to rotate the camera.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Robot Controls</h2>
    <p>
      The robot can be in path mode or free mode. When path mode is active, the
      slider widget at the bottom of the window adjusts the robot's progress
      along a fixed path; when path mode is inactive, the slider widget
      controls the robot's rotation. The robot can be translated by holding the
      shift key and performing a left-click drag with the mouse in the 2D
      viewport.
    </p>
    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <p>
      The settings frame can be opened by clicking the button on the bottom
      left of the window (gear icon). Settings are categorized by geometry
      type and affect how various parts are drawn. Many of these settings
      should be self-explanatory, however note the following important ones:
      <ul>
        <li>General -- Viewing Mode: view only 2D, only 3D, or both</li>
        <li>Subs -- Rendering Style: changes how the surface is drawn in 3D</li>
        <li>Robot -- Use Path: if checked, slider uses the robot's path</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Motion Planning</h2>
    <p>
      WARNING: the custom motion planning does not check for invalid
      configurations and will throw exceptions in the terminal if a path cannot
      be created. This feature is experimental and not well tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each scene comes with a default path for the robot. To create a custom
      path, first click the motion planning button (turning arrow icon). This
      button should appear depressed while you set the start and end
      configurations. To set the start configuration, hold the shift key, use
      the left-click mouse drag to set the position and mouse wheel for
      rotation. To set the end configuration, hold the alt key, use the
      left-click mouse drag to set the position and mouse wheel for rotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once finished, click the motion planning button again. The robot path
      should be updated.
    </p>
