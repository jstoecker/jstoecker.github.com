        <li>Camera pan: left-click and drag the mouse cursor.</li>
        <li>Camera zoom: scroll the mouse wheel.</li>
        <li>Robot translation: hover over the robot's origin, then left-click and drag.</li>
        <li>Robot rotation: hover over the robot's origin, then right-click and drag.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>3D View Controls</h2>
    <p>
      When the mouse cursor is inside the 3D viewport, the following operations
      can be performed:
      <ul>
        <li>Camera rotation: left-click and drag.</li>

      Each scene has a default path for the robot. Use the slider at the bottom of the window to move the robot
      along this path.
    </p>
    <h2>Path Planning</h2>
    <p>
      WARNING: the custom motion planning does not check for invalid
      configurations and will not provide warnings if a path is not found. 
      This feature is experimental and not well tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the arrow button (third from left) to enable path planning mode. At any point, press the ESCAPE key
      to cancel path planning mode. Set the starting configuration for the robot in the 2D view, then press ENTER.
      Set the ending configuration for the robot in the 2D view, then press ENTER. A new path will be created, and
      path planning mode is deactivated.
